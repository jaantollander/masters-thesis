# Computing and Computers
Since the advent of civilization, humans have had a need to store, process and distribute information such as accounting of food reserves and depts, tracking harvesting cycles and weather and writing down laws. This had lead to the emergence of systems like writing, numbers and arithmetic.

Our desire to process information and perform calculation in automated way instead of manually as tedious, error prone human process has lead to the invention and development of various machines from mechanical calculators to the modern digital computers. Information storage has evolved from clay tablets and papyrus to the modern digital storage.

We call the automated calculation as computation and the machines that perform them as computers.

The computers can solve numerical problems that would be impractical or impossible to calculate manually. Such problem include weather prediction, simulation, theorem proving, computer aided design, and many others.

A commonly used abstract, mathematical model of computation is the Turing machine. It consists of a finite set of symbols, a tape memory consisting of these symbols, and finite table of rules of how to transform symbols on the tape.

Turing machine is used as a theoretical tool for classifying computational problems by their difficulty. As a simple computer, the Turing machine is also useful tool for thinking about the essential components of a computer.

Turing machine has important properties such as universality, which means that a Turing machine can simulate any other Turing machine by enconding its symbols, rules, and initial tape by using its own symbols to its own tape and using rules designed to interpret the embeded Turing machine.

- embeded Turing machine though as a program
- universality leads to programmability
- ability to store programs on tape
- distinction between software vs hardware in Turing machine
