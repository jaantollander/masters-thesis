Since the advent of civilization, humans have had a need to store, process and distribute information such as accounting of food reserves and depts, tracking harvesting cycles and weather and writing down laws. This had lead to the emergence of systems like writing, numbers and arithmetic.

Our desire to process information and perform calculation in automated way instead of manually as tedious, error prone human process has lead to the invention and development of various machines from mechanical calculators to the modern digital computers. Information storage has evolved from clay tablets and papyrus to the modern digital storage.

We call the automated calculation as computation and the machines that perform them as computers.

The computers can solve numerical problems that would be impractical or impossible to calculate manually. Such problem include weather prediction, simulation, theorem proving, computer aided design, and many others.

A commonly used abstract, mathematical model of computation is the Turing machine. It consists of a finite set of symbols, a tape memory consisting of these symbols, and finite table of rules of how to transform symbols on the tape.

Turing machine is used as a theoretical tool for classifying computational problems by their difficulty. As a simple computer, the Turing machine is also useful tool for thinking about the essential components of a computer.

Turing machine has important properties such as universality, which means that a Turing machine can simulate any other Turing machine by enconding its symbols, rules, and initial tape by using its own symbols to its own tape and using rules designed to interpret the embeded Turing machine.

- embeded Turing machine though as a program
- universality leads to programmability
- ability to store programs on tape
- distinction between software vs hardware in Turing machine

Modern computer systems are complex and contain many parts. Here are some general characteristics of hardware and software.

hardware

- General and special purpose *processors* which manipulate data by performing operations on them.
- Various *memory* units for storing data, organized hierarchically from volatile, fast, small memory close to the processor to nonvolatile, slow, large memory far from the processor.
- *Buses* for internal data transportation between processors and memory units.
- *Input/Output* for interacting with the computer system.

software

- *Operating System* is a special program which is responsible for the communication between application programs and the hardware.
- *Device Drivers* are programs that enable the operating system to communicate with external devices.
- *Application Programs* are programs executed by the user

Examples:

- parallel processing capabilities, many programs run at the same time
- memory hierarchy, from volatile to nonvolatile, small, fast, volatile memory close to processor to large, slow, nonvolative memory far from processor
- ALU, registers, Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Random Access Memory (RAM)
- storage memory
- specialized processors GPU
- keyboard, mouse, display
