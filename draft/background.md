# Computing and Computers
Our desire to perform calculation automatically instead of manually as tedious, error prone human process has lead to the invention and development of machines that can calculate.

We call the automated calculation as computation and the machines that perform them as computers.

The computers can solve numerical problems that would be impractical or impossible to calculate manually. Such problem include weather prediction, simulation, theorem proving, computer aided design, and many others.

A commonly used abstract, mathematical model of computation is the Turing machine. It consists of a finite set of symbols, a tape memory consisting of these symbols, and finite table of rules of how to transform symbols on the tape. 

Turing machine is used as a theoretical tool for classifying computational problems by their difficulty.

As a simple computer, the Turing machine is also useful tool for thinking about the essential components of a computer.

- universality of turing machine
- ability to store programs on tape
- distinction between software vs hardware in Turing machine
- programmability

Modern computers are complex and contain many parts

- main processor
- specialized processors
- memory hierarchy, volatile and nonvolatile
- input/output

ALU, Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), storage memory, memory hierarchy, specialized processors GPU
