Here is my checklist for finishing the thesis work.

Mandatory
- Mention in results, we cannot release the data set due to privacy, we release the code?
- I need to change "trends" to "load"
- I need to motivate the reader about what we are doing and why it is important in the introduction of every section.
- I need to read through the full text to make sure everything is coherent and in logical order.
- I need to check the grammar for the full text.
- I need to check that all captions have good form.
- I need to check all internal references and add more if needed.

Optional
- I need to send thesis for comments
    - Markus and Matts about time series analysis
    - Simon
    - Henrik
    - Tommi
    - Sebastian
- I might add a figure of rate with wrong values.
  I would need to find a suitable figure for this.
- I might make improvements to the figures.
    - I could add zero to the y-axis in logarithmic plots.
    - I could add minor ticks to plots.
- I might merge the table of file system interface to the table of Lustre operations.
- I might edit the Appendices.
- I might need to mention if the code and data are available or will be in the future.
- I might add figures of the identified outliers in section 5.5 or highlight the identified outliers from the middle subplots.
- I might need to define spikes and bursts.
  We call a high rate that lasts minutes a *spike* and one that lasts for hours a *burst*.
