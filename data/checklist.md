Here is my checklist for finishing the thesis work.

Mandatory
- I need to edit sections 5.0 and 5.5 because I move the description of the explorative data analysis to the Results where it fits better.
- I need to edit the Conclusion and describe what we achieved and the future work in the Conclusion.
- I need to improve the thesis outline in the Introduction.
- I need to add a reference to the increase in data-intensive computing in HPC to the Introduction.
- I need to define the terms in the Terminology section.
- I added some terms to terminology (HPC, computer, storage) that I should also mention in Introduction.
- I need to motivate the reader about what we are doing and why it is important in the introduction of every section.
- I need to read through the full text to make sure everything is coherent and in logical order.
- I need to write English and Finnish abstracts and add the English abstract to the metadata.
- I need to check the grammar for the full text.
- I need to check that all captions have good form.

Optional
- I might add a figure of rate with wrong values.
  I would need to find a suitable figure for this.
- I might make improvements to the figures.
    - I could add zero to the y-axis in logarithmic plots.
    - I could add minor ticks to plots.
- I might merge the table of file system interface to the table of Lustre operations.
- I might edit the Appendices.
- I might need to mention if the code and data are available or will be in the future.
- I might add figures of the identified outliers in section 5.5 or highlight the identified outliers from the middle subplots.
- I might need to define spikes and bursts.
  We call a high rate that lasts minutes a *spike* and one that lasts for hours a *burst*.
