# Conclusion
TODO: what we accomplished


--

TODO: future work, move to discussion section?

- we also intended to compare file system usage to I/O performance probes to see if there were correlations, not enough good quality data
- fix data quality
- gather data from long periods of time
- try using moving aggregates (average, median) with multiple time windows to analyze time series data
- find time intervals from the intersections of the moving aggregates
- measure deviation from the moving aggregate to find outliers
- identify periods of high-load (that correlate with lag), identify who causes the majority of the load during the period
- combine slurm data, use it in the analysis
