% Topic and problem
Many high-performance computing (HPC) systems, typically computer clusters, rely on a global, shared, parallel file system for large storage capacity and bandwidth.
A shared file system is available across the entire system, making it user-friendly but prone to problems from heavy use.
Such use can cause congestion and slow down or even halt the whole system, harming all users who use the parallel file system.
In this thesis, we investigate whether monitoring file system usage in a production system can help identify the causes of slowdowns, such as specific users or jobs.

% Why?
% help system admins to elimate the slowdown, and to improve usability of CSC clusters
% real-time monitoring and warning system
% long-term goal at CSC

% Methods
We monitor the usage of the Lustre parallel file system in CSC's Puhti cluster using a custom monitoring system built around Lustre Jobstats.
We explain the configuration of the Puhti cluster and the monitoring system regarding the file system usage data.

% Results
We discovered issues in the data quality from Lustre Jobstats during the thesis.
We explain these issues in detail and the limitations they imposed on analysis and thesis goals.
Despite the data quality issues, we obtained enough feasible data for analysis.
We demonstrate 24 hours of monitoring data by visually demonstrate low-level and high-level file system usage patterns.
Furthermore, we show that we can use file system usage data to identify causes of relative changes in I/O trends, such as large relative increases.
Finally, we explore ideas for future work on monitoring file system usage.
