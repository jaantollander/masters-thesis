% Preface
\mysection{Preface}
The challenges in this thesis work were primarily practical engineering rather than deep theoretical ones.
For example, we collected, stored, and analyzed large amounts of monitoring data, had to make installations to a live system requiring system admins' intervention, and had issues with software from a third-party vendor.
The software issues caused problems with the data quality, and we lost valuable data that would have been useful in our analysis.
The problem also wasted valuable time because we had to change our monitoring and analysis workflows to correct the issues to the extent that it was possible.
For these reasons, we did not meet the original goals set for the thesis.
Fortunately, we still obtained results and helpful insights for future parallel file system usage monitoring when the vendors hopefully fix these issues.

As acknowledgments, I thank my thesis advisor Sami Ilvonen from CSC, who was instrumental in developing and operating the monitoring system, and the supervising professor Petteri Kaski from Aalto University, for his insights in writing the thesis and help with practical matters.
I also thank Sebastian Von Alfthan for providing the chance to work at CSC; Simon Westersund, who set up the monitoring system; Ulf Tigerstedt, who helped to manage the database; and other people from CSC who were involved.
We also thank the Aalto Scientific Computing admins, who explained their monitoring workflow.
