\mysection{Preface}
The challenges in this thesis work were primarily practical engineering rather than deep theoretical ones.
For example, we had to store, process, and analyze large amounts of data, make changes to a live system requiring system admins' intervention, and had issues with software from third-party vendors.

I thank my thesis advisor Sami Ilvonen, who was instrumental in developing the monitoring system; Simon Westersund, who set up the monitoring system; Sebastian Von Alfthan, for giving me the change to work at CSC; Ulf Tigerstedt, who helped managing the database, and other people from CSC who were involved.
I also thank my supervising professor from Aalto University, Petteri Kaski, who gave many insights into writing the thesis.
We are also grateful to the Aalto scientific computing admins who explained their monitoring workflow to us.
