# Summary
TODO: what we accomplished

TODO: future work

- fix data quality
- gather data from long periods of time
- try using moving aggregates (average, median) with multiple time windows to analyze time series data
- find time intervals from the intersections of the moving aggregates
- measure deviation from the moving aggregate to find outliers
